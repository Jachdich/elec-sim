**Small, obvious bugs**
(e.g 'Control-z does not work when deleting and gate')
Descriptive title is generally enough, if not then short description.

**Larger/less obvious/more obscure bug**
(e.g. 'When saving menu buttons get stuck in one state')
Description and OS/Java version encouraged.

**Crashes/errors**
OS information, Java information and system resources usually needed. Lots of information about when and how the crash happened.
